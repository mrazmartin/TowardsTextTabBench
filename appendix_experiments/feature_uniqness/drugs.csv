Based upon an academic analysis of data from the CDC National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, it is estimated that approximately 1 million adults in the United States have chronic plaque psoriasis that is deemed to be moderate or severe. See e.g., Helmick C., et al., Prevalence of Psoriasis Among Adults in the U.S., 2003-2006 and 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, Am. J. of Prev. Med., 47(1):37–45 (2014).  SKYRIZI may be prescribed for that fraction of adults with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.  SKYRIZI was developed by AbbVie, with research and development costs funded in part by AbbVie.  On April 1, 2016, AbbVie acquired all rights to risankizumab, which was in Phase 3 development for psoriasis, from Boehringer Ingelheim pursuant to a global collaboration agreement. Since that date, all development costs have been funded by AbbVie, and AbbVie is responsible for all development going forward.

The objective of these activities is to raise awareness and understanding about the approved indication, dosing, efficacy and safety data that are consistent with TRIKAFTA’s FDA approved label.    Specific activities related to physicians and health care professionals include print distribution by the commercial field team to CF care centers, digital advertising (e.g., TRIKAFTA’s product website), and other educational programs.   Specific activities related to people living with CF and their caregivers include print distribution of patient materials to CF care centers and digital advertising (e.g., TRIKAFTA’s product website and social media pages). Vertex does not engage in traditional direct-to-consumer advertising (e.g., television or mass media). Vertex also operates a comprehensive patient support program, known as Vertex Guidance & Patient Support (Vertex GPS™), which helps eligible patients who have been prescribed TRIKAFTA (elexacaftor, tezacaftor, ivacaftor and ivacaftor), access their medication and help them stay on track with treatment.   PRICING PLAN:  At Vertex, our mission is ambitious: to discover medicines that can prevent, cure or fundamentally change the outcomes of serious diseases for patients and their families.  Our pricing philosophy supports this mission and reflects the transformative clinical value of our medicines, our commitment to patient access and the investment required to bring new medicines to Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and other serious diseases.    When determining the price of TRIKAFTA, we considered a combination of factors, including:  • Efficacy of the medicine and the benefit to patients of treating the underlying cause of CF, therefore having the potential to modify the course of the disease  • Ease for patients to access medicine  • Impact on a serious orphan disease that places significant burden on the healthcare system and society  • Commitment by Vertex to invest in the resources required to support the discovery and development of new medicines for those waiting for treatments and cures   TRIKAFTA is a significant clinical advancement in the treatment of people with CF aged 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation.  The benefits and risks of TRIKAFTA were evaluated in two Phase 3 studies. In both studies, people taking TRIKAFTA experienced significant improvement in lung function and CF respiratory symptoms.   • One study compared TRIKAFTA with an active comparator, tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor, in people with two F508del mutations. The results showed a significant incremental improvement in lung function and CF respiratory symptoms in the people taking TRIKAFTA.   • The other study compared TRIKAFTA with placebo in people with an F508del mutation and another mutation defined in the study. The results showed significant improvement in lung function, reduction in pulmonary exacerbations, and improvements in CF respiratory symptoms in the people taking TRIKAFTA.",,17300,1,1,,,,,"Based on patient registry data (2017), in the United States, up to 17,300 total patients aged 12 years and older may be eligible for treatment with TRIKAFTA™.",https://reports.siera.oshpd.ca.gov/api/report/drug-pricing/attachment?id=330,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GIVLAARI is currently being reviewed under accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of patients with AHP, after receiving Priority Medicines (PRIME) Designation and Orphan Drug Designation from the EMA.  Alnylam has also filed for marketing authorization in Brazil and intends to file in Japan and other countries in 2020.  Alnylam’s marketing initiatives will focus on raising awareness of the ultra-rare disease acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) and supporting the launch of GIVLAARI and may include multiple comprehensive education and training initiatives that will be provided by Alnylam’s and Ironwood’s employees.  Examples include the development of websites, webcasts and other digital media on the disease state AHP as well as GIVLAARI.  In addition, Alnylam anticipates that it will participate at scientific meetings attended by Healthcare Providers (HCPs) and may engage with HCPs through booth attendance at scientific meetings, printed materials, speaker programs and one on one meetings.   Pricing Plan in the U.S.  When determining the price for GIVLAARI, the following factors influenced our decision-making:  Treatment Effect - GIVLAARI has the potential to substantially benefit patients’ quality of life by reducing the frequency of AHP attacks by >70% compared to placebo.  Potential to Offset Other Healthcare Costs - In the absence of GIVLAARI, an AHP patient can cost $400,000 - $650,000 annually for treatment of attacks, including hospitalization, hemin administration, and other medical interventions. GIVLAARI has been shown to reduce the frequency of attacks thereby providing the potential to reduce or avoid the costs of hospitalization and other interventions.  Alnylam is estimating that the annual average effective net price will be $442,000 based on the average weight-based monthly dose of 1.2 vials per patient in the ENVISION study and before mandatory rebates to government institutions.   Price may vary per individual insurance coverage and dosing.  Ultra-Rare Patient Population - GIVLAARI is an RNAi therapeutic for the adult portion of a population of approximately 3,000 AHP patients with diagnosed, active disease in the U.S. and Europe.  Existing Treatments Are Limited (Unmet Need) - GIVLAARI is a first-of-its-kind FDA-approved therapy available in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with AHP.  Innovative Pricing - Value Based Agreements - Alnylam has announced a framework for value-based agreements (VBAs) designed to help patients with AHP gain access to GIVLAARI.   Under this innovative framework for VBAs, participating government and commercial payers will pay the full value for GIVLAARI only when it delivers patient outcomes in the real-world setting similar to results demonstrated in clinical trials. An additional and newly designed Prevalence-Based Adjustment (PBA) feature will trigger rebates to participating payers if the number of diagnosed patients they cover exceeds current epidemiologic estimates for AHP. There are often uncertainties in diagnosis rates and disease prevalence estimates in ultra-rare diseases, making it challenging for payers to predict the number of patients who will be covered within their plans. This innovative approach offers greater certainty to payers that their overall financial risk will be adjusted if a substantially larger number of patients than currently estimated are identified, diagnosed, and treated with GIVLAARI.   Alnylam’s Patient Access Philosophy - Alnylam’s VBA framework for ultra-rare diseases such as AHP builds upon Alnylam’s Patient Access Philosophy. As part of Alnylam’s Access Philosophy, the Company commits to not increase the price of GIVLAARI by more than the consumer price index for urban consumers (CPI-U), a measure of inflation, in the absence of significant investment associated with a meaningful label expansion. Commercially insured patients are expected to have little-to-no out-of-pocket costs for GIVLAARI.",,3000,1,1,,,,,"Cal.

Additional Context for Report

ORIAHNN was developed by AbbVie under its collaboration agreement with Neurocrine Biosciences, with research and development funded and conducted in part by AbbVie.  On June 16, 2010 AbbVie publicly announced its collaboration with Neurocrine Biosciences for the development of elagolix.  The parties worked together on a collaborative development program through 2012 with funding provided by AbbVie, after which time AbbVie assumed sole responsibility for all development and commercialization activities.  AbbVie made an upfront payment of $75 million and funded all ongoing development activities.  Under the agreement, Neurocrine is eligible to receive additional milestone payments of approximately $530 million for the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, funding for certain internal collaboration expenses, and royalty payments on any future product sales.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FDA Approval Designation
On January 9, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved AYVAKIT™ (avapritinib) for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) harboring a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations. AYVAKIT has FDA Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track Designations for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring PDGFRA D842V mutations  and was approved under Priority Review. 

Expected Utilization
GIST is a rare, genomically driven sarcoma of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. There are approximately 5,000 patients diagnosed with primary GIST in the U.S. annually, and approximately five to six percent of patients with newly diagnosed GIST have PDGFRA exon 18 mutations. The most common PDGFRA exon 18 mutation is the D842V mutation, which is resistant to all other approved therapies. These incidence estimates are based on external data sources, and GIST epidemiology data are imprecise. We do not have state-specific estimates for anticipated AYVAKIT utilization.

1.   Per the attached Product Insert for HELIDAC, this therapy is indicated for treatment of H-Pylori & Duodenal Ulcers.
2.   Out of total US population of ~340 Million, H-Pylori prevalence pool is ~35% which is about ~119 Million people.

3.       Although there is wide prevalence of H-Pylori, only ~10% of the prevalent pool are symptomatic. There are high chances of misdiagnosis based on symptoms alone and often acid suppressants or OTCs are prescribed for prevention of ulcers.
4.       Our source of the market data is the industry standard, IQVIA data. During the time period Dec 2018 to Nov 2019, there have been a total of 59,534 patients diagnosed and undergoing treatment for H Pylori, with a total of 61,748 prescriptions filled with a drug from the same therapeutic class.

QINLOCK™ is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who have received prior treatment with 3 or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib.  For additional information about Qinlock, please see the full Prescribing Information, available at www.qinlock.com. 

Qinlock will be marketed to healthcare professionals (HCPs) by a team of field-based professionals and its expenditures will include spending on the following areas.  

Deciphera’s marketing initiatives will focus on raising awareness of this ultra-rare cancer, GIST, and its potential treatment.  Supporting the launch of Qinlock may include comprehensive education and training initiatives that will be provided by Deciphera’s employees to HCPs about the approved indication, dosing administration, mechanism of action (MOA), efficacy and safety data contained within the FDA approved label.  Deciphera will have available and provide to HCPs, various printed materials, patient brochures as well as offer peer to peer educational programs (in-person and virtual) depicting both the GIST disease state and the FDA-approved clinical profile of Qinlock.  Additional activities may include the development of websites, webcasts, and other digital media offerings.   Deciphera will participate in scientific meetings and congresses that will be attended by HCPs and may engage with HCPs through such attendance.  

Pricing Plan in the U.S.

Deciphera is committed to ensuring patient access and the price for Qinlock was set after doing extensive research and understanding the value of Qinlock relative to other available treatments, as well as the unmet medical need, and disease burden of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor.   Our research also entailed evaluating the competitive landscape, and payer environment, as well as business operational continuation needs.   Deciphera is committed to supporting GIST patients and removing barriers to access. As part of that commitment, Deciphera has established Deciphera AccessPoint, a patient support program that provides reimbursement and financial assistance programs for eligible patients.",,1100,1,1,,,,,"Cal.

[https://investor.lilly.com/static-files/cd4a37af-ec28-449c-9bfb-ae380700209a]","Retevmo™ (selpercatinib) was approved by the FDA in May 2020 as the first therapy specifically indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with advanced or metastatic RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) who require systemic therapy, or advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory (if radioactive iodine is appropriate).

Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data were used to estimate rates of cancer incidence and metastatic disease. Publicly available peer-reviewed literature was reviewed to estimate the prevalence of RET alterations and rates of disease progression by tumor type. Based on this analysis, Lilly estimates that there are 2,500 – 5,000 patients who may be eligible for treatment with a RET kinase inhibitor such as Retevmo.  The average of that range (3,750) is reflected in column H.   Patients with these conditions may or may not take Retevmo.

Based on data from the NCI’s SEER program, approximately 260,000 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in women in the US in 2019. 
Source: National Cancer Institute. Cancer Stat Facts: Female Breast Cancer 2019; https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/breast.html. Accessed December 17, 2019
Of all new cases of breast cancer, approximately 10-15% are diagnosed with TNBC. 
Source: American Cancer Society. Triple-negative breast cancer. https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/understanding-a-breast-cancer-diagnosis/types-of-breast-cancer/triple-negative.html
Approximately 6-10% of new breast cancer cases are initially Stage 4 or metastatic. This is sometimes called “de novo” metastatic disease, meaning from the beginning. 
Source: Metastatic Breast Cancer Network. Incidence and incidence rates. http://mbcn.org/education/category/incidence-and-incidence-rates
Approximately 30-40% of new breast cancer cases (Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3) will progress to Stage 4 or metastatic stage.
Source: Zeichner SB, et al. Breast Cancer Bas Clin Res. 2016;10:25-36
Combining the two data points (de novo metastatic and those who progress to Stage 4) arrives at approximately 10,000 to 11,000 patients. Applying descending treatment rates sequentially from 1L to 2L to 3L you arrive at approximately 8,000 - 9,000 addressable patients. It is important to note that the initial indication for Trodelvy is for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have received at least two prior therapies for metastatic disease. Due to various external factors and dynamics, Immunomedics does not reasonably know how many patients will actually be prescribed TRODELVY.

As such, Meitheal relies on the safety and efficacy findings of the FDA with respect to the innovator drug.  Meitheal markets to group purchasing organizations (GPOs), Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs), and hospital/alternate site (own use) customers based solely on price and availability and therefore does not engage in direct-to-consumer, direct-to-physician, or prescriber marketing. Meitheal does not market based on any aspects of the drug itself, nor does Meitheal aim to treat a certain number of patients. Rather, Meitheal evaluates the size of the total market for a particular drug and strives to achieve a certain market share for that product. Because its Fulvestrant product is a generic product and there are a number of alternative options available, Meitheal Pharmaceuticals does not track the number of patients that are prescribed Fulvestrant. As such, given Fulvestrant's primary use for the treatment of breast cancer, Meitheal's best estimate regarding a patient population can be derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (""CDC"") tracking of breast cancer diagnoses within the United States. According to the CDC's most recent data (in 2017), approximately 239,431 women over the age of 40 were diagnosed with breast cancer. (https://gis.cdc.gov/Cancer/USCS/DataViz.html).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, MorphoSys and our co-promotion partner plan to engage in a marketing plan for tafasitamab-cxix directed to educate providers and patient groups about this potential treatment option for DLBCL. In general, we plan marketing initiatives for tafasitamab-cxix that include print and digital media,  engagement at scientific meetings attended by HCPs most likely to manage patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (R/R DLBCL), materials to be used by our oncology sales managers to share information on tafasitamab with prescribers, materials to be used by our access and policy team with payers and other coverage decision makers regarding medical policy inclusion for tafasitamab and materials to educate patients about relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the United States.

Direct to Consumer (DTC) outreach for SARCLISA will include search, website, and online ad placements.  DTC initiatives are not expected to include any TV, radio or national magazine advertising.

Sanofi’s commitment to pricing rests on three principles: a holistic assessment of value when setting launch prices, year-over-year price increases that are limited to National Health Expenditure projections, and disclosure of our aggregate gross and net prices changes to provide greater transparency about the pricing of our medicines. 
These comprehensive principles were drafted to address questions around the price of medicines in the United States. Our goal is to make our medicines accessible and affordable to all patients. 
We share concerns about the affordability of medicines, and we believe deeply in the important role we play in providing treatments for serious illnesses. We are determined to do our part in pricing our medicines with greater transparency and according to their value, while continuing to advance scientific knowledge and bringing life-saving treatments to patients worldwide.",,30000,,,,,,,"In the United States, it is estimated that there are 131,392 people living with multiple myeloma (MM).  In 2019, according to the American Cancer Society, MM was the third most common hematologic malignancy with 32,110 new cases. The national Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER), reported an annual age-standardized rate of 6.9 per 100,000 person for MM. MM remains an incurable disease with many patients relapsing multiple times throughout the course of the disease. It is estimated that 48%-66% of all treated patients are relapsed refractory multiple myeloma patients. Patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma who have received two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor may be prescribed SARCLISA. Based upon the US prevalence of MM and the information above, sanofi-aventis US LLC reasonably estimates that the number of patients in the United States with a condition for which the new prescription drug may be prescribed is approximately 30,000.

RUKOBIA is a novel attachment inhibitor for the treatment of HIV-1 infection indicated for use in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) therapies in heavily treatment-experienced (HTE) adults with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection, failing their current antiretroviral regimen due to resistance, intolerance or safety considerations. The estimated HTE population who are unable to form a suppressive regimen and potentially eligible for treatment with RUKOBIA is approximately 9,300 for the US.  This is based on the number of people living with HIV according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a projection for the heavily treatment-experienced adult population who are unable to form a suppressive regimen.

Demonstrate early sales traction with stockpiling and pre-positioning sales within 1-3 months of NDA approval.  Reinforce early sales traction through annual Infectious Disease conference attendance/booths in both Europe and US markets.

Launch Strategy:
Website and social media presence that directs inquiries to the infectious disease community and distributors.  Targeting hospitals with calls in historic malaria case regions/countries. Achieve through analysis of historical malaria rates but also ID physician hospital locations available through ID societies. Attend several ID conferences held during the year.  Marketing has already been initiated as official organizations/literature have adopted Artesunate for Injection as first line therapy. This has been augmented by Amivas/USAMMDA cooperating in supplying Artesunate for Injection to the U.S. CDC for compassionate use under their treatment IND and this has been recognized by the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH).
Pricing Plan:
The cost per 110 mg vial of IV Artesunate provided by the manufacturer, Amivas (US), LLC is set at $4,980. Based on the studies conducted in the US, the average number of vials used per dose (2.4 mg/kg) resulting in an estimated cost per dose of roughly $35,403. Amivas conducted a base case cost-effectiveness analysis that had shown an indicative cost per life year saved of $62,232 and is calculated for treatment with Artesunate for Injection compared to using IV Quinine. Following annual 3% discounting of Life Years only as costs are all incurred in the first year, the Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) = $110,469 per life year saved (discounted).

We have determined the launch price of ADUHELM based on our belief in the impact of treatment as well as the size of the appropriate patient population based on the entry criteria of our clinical trials. Biogen has established the price of ADUHELM based on the overall value this treatment is expected to bring to patients, caregivers, and society, while reflecting key principles such as innovation, access and sustainability. The wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of ADUHELM, which is an infusion once every four weeks, is $4,312 per infusion for a patient of 74 kg–the average weight of a U.S. patient with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia. The yearly cost at the maintenance dose (10 mg/kg) would be $56,000. The cost during the first year of treatment will be lower due to the titration period. WAC is a list price and not the net price or the price paid by patients with insurance.
Biogen has a set of Pricing Principles that inform pricing decisions for its products.  Those principles are: 1. Value to Patients, 2. Present and Future Benefit to Society, 3. Fulfilling our commitment to Innovation, 4. Evolution toward Value Based Care, and 5. Affordability & Sustainability.

 where few or no treatments exist?
•Access and Affordability: How can we assure that various customers-including national, regional or local institutional payers, physicians, employers and patients-can afford to pay for our products?
•R&D sustainability: Given the long-term risk and cost of capital, are we appropriately compensating our investors to ensure that we can continue the risky and capital-intensive biopharmaceutical research and development that will bring forward medically-important breakthroughs?

At any given time, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may affect up to 30% of VHL patients in the US [Chittiboina P, Lonser RR. Handb Clin Neurol. 2015;132:139–156.].  For patients with tumors that reach greater than 3cm in size, a partial nephrectomy may be performed to reduce the risk of metastasis while maintaining kidney function[Varshney N et al. J Kidney Cancer VHL. 2017;4:20–29.].  Additionally, it is estimated Central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas affecting 60% to 80% of all patients [Varshney N, Kebede AA, Owusu-Dapaah H, et al. A review of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.

(1) Consistent with the relevant statutes and regulations, all information contained in this report is limited to that which Par believes is otherwise in the public domain or publicly available, as of the date of this submission. As a result, Par has left the marketing and pricing plan description data field blank.

(2) Par did not conduct any epidemiologic studies or analyses on the incidence and prevalence of the conditions, at the patient level, treated by this product. Par notes that this product is indicated adjunct to other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. The World Health Organization (“WHO”) indicates approximately 1,710,000,000 people have musculoskeletal conditions world-wide (see https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/musculoskeletal-conditions#:~:text=%20Musculoskeletal%20conditions%20include%20conditions%20that%20affect%3A%20,body%20areas%20or%20systems%2C%20such%20as...%20More%20 ).

However, WHO does not specify the number of patients diagnosed each month or year with musculoskeletal conditions. Further, Par does not know, and does not have access to, the prescribing patterns of healthcare practitioners at the patient level. 

Par is therefore unable to provide any additional detail regarding the Estimated Number of Patients who may be prescribed Par’s Chlorzoxazone Tablets because the information is not in the public domain. Thus, we understand our initial filings to be consistent with the statute, Cal.

This limitation is further noted on the OSHPD’s webpage titled “Prescription Drugs Introduced to Market” that contains the most recent published new drug reports. This webpage states: “Manufacturers may withhold information that is not in the public domain.” See Prescription Drugs Introduced to Market, available at: https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/prescription-drugs-introduced-to-market.

Par notes that this product is indicated for the prevention of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease.

Regeneron approaches pricing with fairness, affordability and access at the forefront.  Our pricing philosophy is guided by several principles.

Third, our growth is driven by scientific innovation, not pricing.  Any price changes Regeneron makes is designed to keep pace with the medicine’s value and our costs, and in careful consideration of commercial competitiveness.

Therefore, Cost-based, quality-adjusted, or value-based pricing were not used to establish WAC for this product.",,1200000,,,,,,,"The reason for leaving the acquisition-related fields blank was because Strides developed the drug.

We will also promote Exkivity to appropriate healthcare professionals, who treat individuals diagnosed with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Exon 20 insertion, a rare condition, through engagement at scientific meetings and conferences. Takeda considers a number of factors when deciding the price at which to set its prescription drugs, including, but not limited to: (i) the value medicine brings to patients and society; (ii) access to medicines; and (iii) providing a thoughtful approach that allows us to continue to deliver innovative medicines. Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Exon20 insertion+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) make up approximately 1-2% of patients with NSCLC. This disease carries a worse prognosis than other EGFR mutations and has been historically underserved. Exkivity is a first-in-class, oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) specifically designed to selectively target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Exon20 insertion mutations. In establishing WAC, Takeda also evaluated the access landscape for EGFR Exon20 insertion+ NSCLC patients, including the current treatment landscape and associated costs, likelihood of payor coverage, and options for patients without coverage.

UKONIQ™ was approved on 2/5/2021 as a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based regimen and relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least three prior lines of systemic therapy.  TG has designed marketing activities to raise awareness and understanding with healthcare providers and - in some cases - patients about the approved indications, efficacy and safety data contained within UKONIQ’s FDA approved label. 

     • UKONIQ will not have any DTC advertisements on any platforms at launch.  We will, however, have a patient-facing website that provides information about UKONIQ, the diseases it is approved to treat, and the TG Patient Support Program.

     • At launch TG will not offer coupons or free trials.  However, at launch TG will offer copayment assistance to commercially insured patients through the TG Patient Support Program.  Information about the TG Patient Support Program, including the commercial co-pay program, will be provided to healthcare providers (“HCPs”) by our sales representatives and via an HCP website, and to patients via a patient-facing website.

Pricing Plan:

TG Therapeutics was founded with one broad mission: to develop novel and valuable treatment options for patients with B-cell diseases. Our commitment to patients, however, goes beyond science. We believe that access is essential in ensuring advances are available to patients who are in need of treatment options.  Ahead of our first commercial launch, we created a unique approach to our decision-making around access and pricing anchored on the clinical value of our products and guided by three core pillars: fiercely focused on patients, access and solutions. These guiding principles are inspired by our mission, shaped our pricing decision for UKONIQ and will continue to shine through in our commitment to patients.

Pricing:  Merck considers several factors in determining the price of our medications. These factors are listed below and are largely based on the value of the product, as well as the competitive landscape, and market for the medication.
•Value provided to patients: To what extent does a new medicine or vaccine establish a new standard of care that has the potential to significantly extend and improve patient lives?
•Value provided to healthcare systems: To what extent does a new medicine or vaccine reduce the costs associated with hospitalization and other costly complications of disease if not appropriately (or optimally) treated?
•Unmet need: Does a new medicine or vaccine address a critical unmet medical need for large numbers of people,
 where few or no treatments exist?
•Access and Affordability: How can we assure that various customers-including national, regional or local institutional payers, physicians, employers and patients-can afford to pay for our products?
•R&D sustainability: Given the long-term risk and cost of capital, are we appropriately compensating our investors to ensure that we can continue the risky and capital-intensive biopharmaceutical research and development that will bring forward medically-important breakthroughs? 
•Competition: What are the costs of other treatments and interventions currently on the market relative to the value provided by Merck's products?",,200,,,,,,,"Marketing/Pricing Plan (Non Public):  Consistent with SB 17, Merck has limited its response to information publicly available or otherwise in the public domain.

Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Priority Review Indicators:  NOXAFIL PowderMix was not granted breakthrough therapy designation or priority review.

Noxafil injection and Noxafil delayed-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in adults and pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. 
Noxafil is indicated for the prophylaxis of invasive Aspergillus and Candida infections in patients who are at high risk of developing these infections due to being severely immunocompromised, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients with graftversus-host disease (GVHD) or those with hematologic malignancies with prolonged neutropenia from chemotherapy as follows: 
- Noxafil injection: adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older 
- Noxafil delayed-release tablets: adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older who weigh greater than 40 kg 
- Noxafil oral suspension: adults and pediatric patients 13 years of age and older

Noxafil oral suspension is indicated for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), including OPC refractory (rOPC) to itraconazole and/or fluconazole in adult and pediatric patients aged 13 years and older.

To estimate the average number of patients, data from The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), US Health Resources and Services Administration HRSA) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was examined.  Stem cell transplants were identified in the US between 2016 and 2020 for patients age 0-10.  The occurrence rate for pediatrics patients, with GVHD, was applied to determine the number of potential patients per year.  Estimated average number of patients who will be prescribed Noxafil PowderMix for delayed-release oral suspension annually in the U.S is approximately 200, or approximately 16-17 patients monthly.

Par notes that this product is indicated to reduce chronic severe drooling in patients aged 3 to 16 years with neurologic conditions associated with problem drooling (e.g., cerebral palsy).

The forum on Child and Family Statistics estimates as of 2022 there are approximately 74.3 million children in the United States ( https://www.childstats.gov/americaschildren/tables/pop1.asp).

The Centers for Disease Control state that 1 in 345 children have been identified with Cerebral Palsy. (https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/cp/features/cerebral-palsy-11-things.html ).

The National Institutes of Health reported in 2016 between 10% and 58% of children with Cerebral Palsy have excess drooling, with estimates that 10% of children with excessive drooling have embarrassing drooling ( 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27281791/ , https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2827743/ ).

Par has not independently verified this information.

Further, Par does not know, and does not have access to, the prescribing patterns of healthcare practitioners at the patient level, Par is unable to accurately provide an estimate of the average number of patients that will be prescribed this product each month.

Par is therefore unable to provide any additional detail regarding the Estimated Number of Patients who may be prescribed Par’s product because the information is not in the public domain. Thus, we understand our initial filings to be consistent with the statute, Cal. Health & Safety Code § 127681(c), which allows a manufacturer to “limit the information reported pursuant to subdivision (b) to that which is otherwise in the public domain or publicly available.” Subdivision (b) of the same requires the number of estimated patients to be included in new drug reports. This limitation is further noted on the OSHPD’s webpage titled “Prescription Drugs Introduced to Market” that contains the most recent published new drug reports. This webpage states: 
“Manufacturers may withhold information that is not in the public domain.” See Prescription Drugs Introduced to Market, available at:

Rigel’s approach for a new product launch is to develop marketing materials for our sales teams to educate healthcare professionals on the appropriate utilization of REZLIDHIA consistent with the US FDA approved indication. Rigel utilizes printed materials, websites, and other digital media to communicate this information to relevant healthcare professionals.  We provide patient assistance programs, including a copay assistance program which can be found at www.rezlidhia.com, and our Rigel OneCare program which aids in patient support services, benefit verifications, prior authorizations, temporary and long term free drug supply, and adherence support.  Additional company and product information is included on Rigel’s website at www.rigel.com. Rigel gives careful consideration to a number of interdependent factors when setting the price of the Company’s pharmaceutical products, some of which include the clinical and economic value that a particular therapy provides to the patients and the nation’s healthcare system overall (e.g. objective and subjective measures of individual health outcomes and overall costs of therapy in both inpatient and outpatient settings, for public and private facilities and payors).  Fundamentally, Rigel gives serious consideration to a number of factors impacting the final price determined for each of its products, including Rezlidhia, including but not limited to; (1) clinical and economic value of a particular therapy, (2) the therapeutic category, its market dynamics, and competitor pricing, (3) discounts provided to customers in both the commercial and government channels, (4) patient support provided by Rigel to ensure patient access to life-saving and life-changing medications, (5) ongoing capital investments, and (6) overall research and development or product acquisition costs. This consideration into pricing is based on an overall assessment of the particular circumstances of these and other interdependencies and the judgement and expertise of Rigel’s leadersip team, and does not follow a fixed algorithm.  Related to the product pricing is the discounted pricing available in certain circumstances, generally a fixed percent off the wholesale acquisition cost, which is set by contract or regulation, and is based on assessment of market dynamics, product access, and overall commercial economics.",,20380,,,2022-07-27,2000000,,"Under the terms of the agreement, Forma will receive an upfront payment of $2.0 million, and is eligible to receive an additional $17.5 million upon the achievement of certain near-term regulatory, approval, and first commercial sale milestones.

CAD is a chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia caused by an auto-antibody that targets red blood cells. The amount of autoimmune hemolytic anemia that a patient experiences will differ between patients and is in part determined by the temperature at which the cold agglutinin binds to the patients red blood cells. As a result, patients may experience mild, moderate or severe levels of anemia with intermittent exacerbations of symptoms and anemia. While Enjaymo is indicated for the treatment of all CAD patients regardless of severity, physicians may prefer to reserve pharmacologic treatment for symptomatic patients. In observational studies, the proportion of patients observed experiencing moderate to severe levels of anemia ranged from ~ 45% to 80% (Mullins 2017).

According to the NIH, between 13 and 20 million intubations are performed annually in the United States (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7517927/#:~:text=Between%2013%20and%2020%20million,emergency%20to%20secure%20the%20airway.), but Civica is not in a position to estimate the proportion of those intubations for which Cisatracurium would be indicated.

Considerable efforts were expended in drug development and research, as Vyjuvek is the first and only treatment that addresses the genetic cause of DEB. Given the rarity of the condition Vyjuvek treats, Krystal Biotech employed methodologies based on research and development costs, as well as the value this product brings to the limited patient population that is affected by DEB.

Regeneron approaches pricing with fairness, affordability and access at the forefront.  Our pricing philosophy is guided by several principles.  

First, medicines should be priced fairly.  We take a value-based pricing approach that reflects their benefit to patients, society and the healthcare system.  We consider the long-term investment and risk inherent in science and technology innovation, which is required to bring novel medicines to patients.  

Second, medicines are only useful if patients in need can access and afford them.  We are committed to supporting patients’ access by providing financial assistance for eligible patients.

Third, our growth is driven by scientific innovation, not pricing.  Any price changes Regeneron makes is designed to keep pace with the medicine’s value and our costs, and in careful consideration of commercial competitiveness.

Regeneron also seeks to work collaboratively with other stakeholders in the healthcare system and welcome their input on fair and cost-effective pricing.  These principles taken together help to ensure advancing our goal of setting fair, value-based prices for our medicines and breaking down barriers to patient access.",,600000,,1,,,,,"All information submitted by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development under Cal.

Sanofi understands and shares concerns about the affordability of medicines for patients while also recognizing that we are only one of many stakeholders in the health care system.

When we set the price of a new medicine, we hold ourselves to a rigorous and structured process that includes consultation with external stakeholders and considers a holistic assessment of value through clinical, economic and societal lens; similar treatment options, affordability and unique factors specific to the medicine at time of launch (i.e., longer-term outcome studies, sophisticated patient support tools, etc.).",,25000,1,1,,,,,"Hemophilia A, also called factor VIII (8) deficiency or classic hemophilia, is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective factor VIII (FVIII), a clotting protein.

At Sanofi, we work passionately to prevent, treat, and cure illness and disease, understand and solve health care needs of people across the world, and transform the practice of medicine. Sanofi has a longstanding commitment to promote health care systems that make our treatments accessible and affordable to patients in need. 
Sanofi understands and shares concerns about the affordability of medicines for patients while also recognizing that we are only one of many stakeholders in the health care system. In order to maintain an environment that will continue to bring new health care solutions to patients, we must encourage a transition to a value-driven health care system that provides incentives for the highest-quality care. This evolution will enable both affordable access to treatment and continued investment in medical innovation.   Sanofi is committed to helping address this challenge. While many factors, including decisions affecting patient out-of-pocket spending and insurance coverage, are controlled by other stakeholders in the health care system, we believe we have a responsibility to be a leader in solving issues of patient access and system viability. For our part, we price our medicines according to their value, while contributing to broader solutions that improve patient outcomes and support affordability within the U.S. health care system.
When we set the price of a new medicine, we hold ourselves to a rigorous and structured process that includes consultation with external stakeholders and considers a holistic assessment of value through clinical, economic and societal lens; similar treatment options, affordability and unique factors specific to the medicine at time of launch (i.e., longer-term outcome studies, sophisticated patient support tools, etc.).",,25000,1,1,,,,,"Hemophilia A, also called factor VIII (8) deficiency or classic hemophilia, is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective factor VIII (FVIII), a clotting protein.

ESR1 mutations have been reported in up to 39% of patients with ER/PR-positive, HER2 negative advanced or mBC who have received prior treatment with an aromatase inhibitor in the metastatic setting (Reinert 2017).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"TG Therapeutics, Inc.",73150015006,BRIUMVI (ublituximab-xiiy) 150 mg/6 mL Vial,2023-01-26,9833.33,"Marketing Plan:

BRIUMVI was approved on 12/28/22 as a CD20-directed cytolytic antibody indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults.  TG Therapeutics has designed marketing activities to raise awareness and understanding with Healthcare Providers, Patients and Care Partners about the approved indications, efficacy, safety and patient support services offerings available.
 
 TG Therapeutics will take a very targeted approach to paid advertising to both Healthcare Providers, Patients and Care Partners.  TG is not planning on executing DTC advertising via TV executions at this time, instead there will be a focus on leveraging digital platforms such as banner, social media, paid search, etc. We will, however, have a patient-facing website that provides information about BRIUMVI, the diseases it is approved to treat, and the BRIUMVI Patient Support Program.

At launch TG will not offer coupons or free trials or other promotional incentives.  However, at launch TG will offer copayment assistance to commercially insured patients through the BRIUMVI Patient Support Program.  Information about the BRIUMVI Patient Support Program, including the commercial co-pay program, will be provided to healthcare providers (“HCPs”) by our sales representatives and via an HCP website, and to patients via a patient-facing website.

In preparation for launch over the 2022 calendar year, promotional spend was focused on creating content for HCPs to raise awareness of TG Therapeutics, including medical congress activities and unbranded speaker programs.  From a branded perspective promotional spend was focused on developing content in anticipation for the launch of BRIUMVI, including non-personal promotion (branded website and in office resources).

Pricing Plans:

TG Therapeutics was founded with one broad mission: to develop novel and valuable treatment options for patients with B-cell diseases. Our commitment to patients, however, goes beyond science. We believe that access is essential in ensuring advances are available to patients who are in need of treatment options.  This is why we created a unique approach to our decision-making around access and pricing anchored on the clinical value of our products and guided by three core pillars: fiercely focused on patients, access and solutions. TG Therapeutics is committed to responsible pricing and partnership across the healthcare system and we listened carefully to the MS community, including neurologists, patients, payers and advocacy groups to ensure that we priced BRIUMVI to optimize access for patients.",,70000,,,2012-01-30,,1,"TG Therapeutics does not believe the acquisition price is in the public domain or publicly available.

Each year there are approximately 80,000 – 90,000 patients in the US who are in need of a new MS treatment.
